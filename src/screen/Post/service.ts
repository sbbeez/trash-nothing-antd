I have a bad immune system and can no longer wait until it’s safe to have a yard sale because a relative shipped us some heirloom furniture & it’s about to be delivered. I have  Baskets, boxes, jewelry, glass ware, books, unused photo albums, more jewelry and jewelry making supplies, vases, Knick-knacks, boys clothes (size 4-6) watch parts, toys, did I mention the jewelry and various household items, etc. \nIf you need something, take it! I will have a jar out for donations, but they’re not required. (I’m also posting this on cl yardsales) \n\nI do ask that you please do not take the plastic bins and buckets. There will be plastic shopping bags available. \n\nI’m on Emporia Point Court 77494",

I need it so that she can sleep in it overnight in the place we are renting . It may just be me, but I’m too nervous to still have her sleep with me in the bed bc of SIDS. Something that looks like this would be great.. thank you in advance\n\n\nhttps://trashnothing.com/pics/KGiN7F2",
